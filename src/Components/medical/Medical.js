                                    Who makes more money a CA or CS?

                            <AccordionItemPanel>

                                On an average, compensation for CA is much higher than that of a CS.

                        </AccordionItem>

                                    Is CS simpler than CA?
                                </AccordionItemButton>

                            <AccordionItemPanel>

                                This varies for different students, depending on their aptitude. But most people feel that CS is much easier but in reality CA is more math-oriented and CS more theory-based.

                                Time management
                                Manage your study time as well as manage your examination time. How much time you need to devote to each question is something you will have to carefully plan out.
                                Know the syllabus
                                So, you can plan to study and revise all the topics within all subjects.
                                Divide and Revise the topics
                                This is one of the best strategies, as it helps you cover all the topics without feeling like a burden.
                                Study daily
                                Study daily, practice question papers or mock papers and do this within a time limit.
                                Solving Previous Years Papers
                                Mock papers are good to test your knowledge, knowing your speed and also gives you confidence.
